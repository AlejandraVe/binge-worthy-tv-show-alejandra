            Once Upon a Time is an American fantasy adventure drama television series that aired for seven seasons on
            ABC from
            October 23, 2011, to May 18, 2018. The action alternates between two main settings: a fantastical world
            where fairy
            tales happen, and a fictional seaside town in Maine called Storybrooke. The "real-world" part of the story
            unfolds with
            the characters of Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and her 10-year-old son, Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore).
            Henry discovers
            the other people of the town are fairy-tale characters. The audience is shown the backstory of the town's
            people as
            fairy-tale characters, in conjunction with their unfolding stories in the "real-world".

            Once Upon a Time was created by Lost and Tron: Legacy writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. The core
            themes of the
            show are hope and optimism. Horowitz told The Hollywood Reporter that they had a conscious purpose to "do a
            show that
            had optimism at its heart", as they "felt like there was so much darkness in the world". Kitsis said: "We
            are guys who
            like to see the world as half-full, not half-empty", and it's about "seeing that among all the trials and
            tribulations
            of life, you can persevere and find light among the darkness"; "it's that ability to think your life will
            get
            better".
